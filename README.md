# SignatureVerify
SignatureVerify is a tool to verify if a signature is legit or if someone is trying to forge it.
The algorithm developed is a 2D Convolutional Neural Network applied on a Time Series to mimic the movement of a pen writing a signature on a flat surface. The interface is a HTML-CSS-JS Web-App that connects to the Python algorithm through a Flask Python server.

The output given by the interface is the probability of a given signature being of certain individual.
